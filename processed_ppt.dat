PowerPoint Designer Updates Patrick Lung 3 5 2018 FFFFFF
MVP Release Designer was released in November 2015 on Win32 with 12 000 blueprints supporting image scenarios FFFFFF
Scaling Usage From 0 to 1 6M slides kept in a single day FFFFFF
IncreasingCoverage Increasing the of slides in a deck Designer can work with Without significant coverage cross slide scenarios become more challenging Key Addressed Coverage Dimensions Scaling to supported themes and variants Multi photo Small images Banner bars Re mapping layouts Charts FFFFFF
Experimentation Unlike client software every request goes through our very latest service build This allows us to make changes and iterate at insane speed several times a day Invested heavily in telemetry infrastructure and logging dashboarding to drive these rapid improvements 94 experiments in 2017 FFFFFF
Enabling Text Scenarios As we were expanding coverage a key missing scenario was text only slides Created text billboards as a way to maintain continuity between Designer suggestions and text only slides Pure layout and design change no change to text itself or content additions FFFFFF
Initial Text Transformations As a means to attack death by PowerPoint we aimed to transform text slides to visualizations in particular high value scenarios processes and timelines Partnered with our natural language team NLX to create a rules based model to detect processes and timelines and transform them to brand new SmartArt layouts FFFFFF
Expanding SmartArt usage After success with processes and timelines we wanted to expand our text transformation capabilities Partnered with Office ML team led by Robert Roundwaite to pioneer a machine learned model Model now runs side by side with rules based NLX model and outperforms it 20 50x Note We are still early in this journey developing a proper ML flywheel FFFFFF
Designer Accomplishments from 2017 FFFFFF
Constant iteration led to 530 usage vs 2016 Experiment examples Tuning service rules to find a balance where usage increases while maintaining an acceptable keep rate Identifying when best to transform text to SmartArt and icons Adjusting the ranker to provide more variety as well as increasingly personalized suggestions 2016 2017 FFFFFF
Works more often in more places Now supporting co authoring charts and animations We ve also added iPad support to the existing endpoints of Windows Mac Online and Android FFFFFF
Object Level Transformations Designer offers to replace blocks of text with SmartArt even if it does not understand the rest of your slide To make this work Designer was unbundled into a set of micro services and leverages an augmentation loop This is the first step towards transforming users content to make it more impactful FFFFFF
Suggests icons based on your content Designer helps you communicate more visually by recognizing key words on your slides to suggest relevant icons This is the first step towards suggesting more content to enrich users presentations FFFFFF
Upsells Office 365 We tested a trial that offers Designer on a limited basis on PPT Online to OneDrive non O365 users Different variations of time and number of uses were flighted to find the best performing trial This was an initial experiment in this direction and we re excited to learn more FFFFFF
Learns your preferences to suggest similar ideas Our service learns what layouts you prefer and surfaces them higher to help you make a more consistent deck This is the first step towards an increasingly personalized Designer experience FFFFFF
More natural experience The Designer pane shows design ideas more often and has less loading animations It refreshes after common actions instead of closing merges typing changes directly in the client and loads new ideas in place This is the first step towards making Designer a more contextual service FFFFFF
More design idea types Each set of design ideas has more variety showing at once different layouts themes SmartArts mixing colors and styles and icons This flexibility allows our system to mix many scenarios together and is the first step towards more variety in Designer FFFFFF
Customer Feedback and Research Why isn t the feature enabled There is a large set of users who have older versions or non subscription versions and want the feature Why am I not seeing ideas Users with unsupported slides lots of objects or custom themes want to get Design Ideas Want more varied ideas Users of Designer report the desire for more and more designs to keep things fresh Consistency is key As users use Designer more and more in their presentations they are now looking for ways to help tie everything together FFFFFF

Activity Pane The POR is to use changes info done by revision tracking feature Limitations of changes info Slide level changes are summarized per session per slide with only last timestamp left Slide level changes include Add delete reorder slides Add delete modify animations Add delete modify comments Modify notes Modify transition Change layout This means We won t have accurate timestamps for every slide level changes We won t have the exact order or count of slide level changes FFFFFF
Activity Pane Options Keep using changes info Persist comment changes info individually no file format changes just save more during runtime Doesn t solve the inaccurate timestamp problem Need some UI treatment to work around it Mention activities won t be available until file format changes Send activities to ODSP store No all activity content will be saved to ODSP only the references Pro of this approach is we can share most of the client server implementation built by WAC FFFFFF

VRF VRF has its significance local to the router Each peering type on each MSEE has a unique VRF name such as VRF for Private peering and Public peering Hence routing logic for respective peering depends on the Route table of that VRF Microsoft peering is part of default or global VRF If not specified all interfaces will be part of this default global VRF 0072C6
