PowerPoint Designer .Updates .Patrick Lung .3/5/2018 . FFFFFF
MVP Release .Designer was released in November 2015 on Win32 with 12,000 blueprints supporting image scenarios . FFFFFF
Scaling Usage .From 0 to 1.6M slides kept in a single day. . FFFFFF
IncreasingCoverage .Increasing the # of slides in a deck Designer can work with .Without significant coverage, cross-slide scenarios become more challenging .Key Addressed Coverage Dimensions .Scaling to supported themes and variants .Multi-photo .Small images .Banner bars .Re-mapping layouts .Charts . FFFFFF
Experimentation .Unlike client software, every request goes through our very latest service build .This allows us to make changes and iterate at insane speed (several times a day) .Invested heavily in telemetry infrastructure and logging/dashboarding to drive these rapid improvements .94 experiments in 2017 . FFFFFF
Enabling Text Scenarios .As we were expanding coverage, a key missing scenario was text-only slides .Created “text billboards” as a way to maintain continuity between Designer suggestions and text only slides .Pure layout and design change—no change to text itself or content additions . FFFFFF
Initial Text Transformations .As a means to attack “death by PowerPoint” we aimed to transform text slides to visualizations in particular high-value scenarios: processes and timelines .Partnered with our natural language team (NLX) to create a rules-based model to detect processes and timelines and transform them to brand-new SmartArt layouts . FFFFFF
Expanding SmartArt usage .After success with processes and timelines, we wanted to expand our text transformation capabilities .Partnered with Office ML team led by Robert Roundwaite to pioneer a machine-learned model .Model now runs side by side with rules-based NLX model and outperforms it 20-50x .Note: We are still early in this journey; developing a proper ML flywheel . FFFFFF
Designer Accomplishments from 2017 . FFFFFF
Constant iteration led to 530% usage vs. 2016 .Experiment examples: .Tuning service rules to find a balance where usage increases while maintaining an acceptable keep rate .Identifying when best to transform text to SmartArt and icons .Adjusting the ranker to provide more variety as well as increasingly personalized suggestions .2016 .2017 . FFFFFF
Works more often in more places .Now supporting co-authoring, charts, and animations!  .We've also added iPad support to the existing endpoints of Windows, Mac, Online, and Android.  . FFFFFF
Object Level Transformations .Designer offers to replace blocks of text with SmartArt, even if it does not understand the rest of your slide. .To make this work, Designer was unbundled into a set of micro-services and leverages an augmentation loop. .This is the first step towards transforming users’ content to make it more impactful.  . FFFFFF
Suggests icons based on your content .Designer helps you communicate more visually by recognizing key words on your slides to suggest relevant icons.  .This is the first step towards suggesting more content to enrich users’ presentations.  . FFFFFF
Upsells Office 365 .We tested a trial that offers Designer on a limited basis on PPT Online to OneDrive non-O365-users.  .Different variations of time and number of uses were flighted to find the best performing trial. .This was an initial experiment in this direction and we’re excited to learn more.   . FFFFFF
Learns your preferences to suggest similar ideas .Our service learns what layouts you prefer and surfaces them higher to help you make a more consistent deck.  .This is the first step towards an increasingly personalized Designer experience. . FFFFFF
More natural experience .The Designer pane shows design ideas more often and has less loading animations.  .It refreshes after common actions instead of closing, merges typing changes directly in the client, and loads new ideas in place. .This is the first step towards making Designer a more contextual service. . FFFFFF
More design idea types .Each set of design ideas has more variety, showing at once, different: layouts, themes, SmartArts (mixing colors and styles), and icons.  .This flexibility allows our system to mix many scenarios together and is the first step towards more variety in Designer. . FFFFFF
Customer Feedback and Research .Why isn’t the feature enabled? .There is a large set of users who have older versions or non-subscription versions and want the feature. .Why am I not seeing ideas? .Users with unsupported slides (lots of objects or custom themes) want to get Design Ideas. .Want more varied ideas .Users of Designer report the desire for more and more designs to keep things fresh. .Consistency is key .As users use Designer more and more in their presentations, they are now looking for ways to help tie everything together .

Impact COGS if session not close in time, delay release of resource, etc. .Next steps: . Will need SPO to confirm root cause and fix.  Capacity issues and DB reliability   .We are adding some telemetry to have deeper understanding on what is the retry success rate for different errors .Get SLA from SPO on WOPI reliability  .POPS role overloaded the capacity​​ incident 70084223 .

Collab .@mention missing support for down-level clients .Prod blocking and may push out Wave 2 .@mention is encoded as JSON text and embedded as part of the comment text. This caused problems with down-level clients which will show the encoded JSON as plain text. .Docs team are working on solutions and the following two candidates are currently on the table: .Patch the legacy clients to recognize the at mention format .Re-rev file format for comments . FFFFFF
Collab .Comment perf issue  .LinkedIn customer feedback (video) mentioned perf issues with comments comparing with G slides. .Identified a regression with delete comment with the new comment pane. Tracked by VSO 2207710.  .For add/edit/reply comment, the perf characteristic is the same as legacy comment pane. VSO 2207711 is tracking the improvements to update UI before getting confirmation from backend. . FFFFFF

Activity Pane .The POR is to use changes info done by revision tracking feature .Limitations of changes info .Slide level changes are summarized per session per slide, with only last timestamp left .Slide level changes include .Add/delete/reorder slides .Add/delete/modify animations .Add/delete/modify comments .Modify notes .Modify transition .Change layout .… .This means: .We won't have accurate timestamps for every slide level changes .We won't have the exact order or count of slide level changes . FFFFFF
Activity Pane .Options .Keep using changes info .Persist comment changes info individually (no file format changes, just save more during runtime) .Doesn't solve the inaccurate timestamp problem. Need some UI treatment to work around it. .Mention activities won't be available until file format changes .Send activities to ODSP store .No all activity content will be saved to ODSP, only the "references" .Pro of this approach is we can share most of the client/server implementation built by WAC .
